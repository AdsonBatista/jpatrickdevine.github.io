### Overview

A few years ago I decided to go back to school for IT. In May of 2019 I finished a Bachelor of Science at [Peirce College](https://www.peirce.edu "Peirce College") in Center City Philadelphia with a concentration in Programming and Application Development.

Previously, I worked in fine-dining French and Italian restaurants in Boston, Central Florida, and Philadelphia, and I have a Bachelor of Arts degree in French Studies from [University of North Florida](https://www.unf.edu "University of North Florida") in Jacksonville.

### Current Interests

My courses at Peirce revolve around general programming techniques and practices, but in self-directed study I have also learned the following:

* Bootstrap & jQuery
* Sass
* Git and *nix Terminal
* Jekyll
* PHP
* Materialize CSS
